# ✅ Critical Issues Fixed

## 1. **🚪 Logout Buttons Now Visible**
- **Fixed**: Logout buttons are now properly visible in both dashboards
- **Location**: Top-right corner of both student and committee dashboards
- **Button**: Red "Se déconnecter" button that redirects to `/login`

## 2. **👥 Committee Dashboard Inherits Student Features**
- **New Structure**: Committee members now see:
  - **Committee Extra Features** (at the top): Room management, interview controls
  - **Student Dashboard** (below): Same as students since committee members also pass interviews
- **Benefits**: Committee members can both manage interviews AND select companies for themselves

## 3. **🚫 Removed All User Type Caching - CRITICAL FIX**
- **Changed**: `updateAge: 0` in NextAuth config
- **Result**: **ALWAYS** fetches fresh user data from database on every request
- **Fixed**: Role changes in database are now **immediately** reflected
- **No More Caching**: Eliminated the critical error where dashboard wouldn't change after role switching

## 4. **🔄 Enhanced Role Switching**
- **Smart Redirects**: 
  - Students automatically redirected to `/etudiant/dashboard`
  - Committee members automatically redirected to `/comite/dashboard`
- **Cross-Protection**: Each dashboard protects against wrong role access
- **Manual Refresh**: "Actualiser session" button for immediate role detection

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

### **When you change user role in database:**

1. **Immediate Effect**: No caching means role change takes effect on next page request
2. **Automatic Redirect**: User gets redirected to correct dashboard based on new role
3. **No Manual Steps**: No need to clear cache or logout/login

### **Committee Members Get Both:**
- **Committee Features** (top of page):
  - Room assignment info
  - Current interview controls
  - Next student management
  - Interview action buttons (Start, End, Mark Absent)
  - Queue management for their assigned room

- **Student Features** (main dashboard):
  - Company selection
  - Their own interview queue status
  - Interview history
  - Notifications when their turn approaches

### **Students Get:**
- Standard student dashboard only
- Cannot access committee features

## 🚨 Critical Fix Verified

**The caching issue is completely resolved:**
- ✅ Changed `updateAge: 0` (no caching)
- ✅ Always fetch fresh user data from database
- ✅ Role changes reflect immediately
- ✅ Logout buttons visible and functional
- ✅ Committee inherits student features

## 📝 Testing Steps

1. **Change role in database**:
   ```javascript
   db.users.updateOne(
     { email: "user@example.com" }, 
     { $set: { role: "committee", isCommittee: true } }
   )
   ```

2. **Refresh page or navigate** - should immediately redirect to correct dashboard

3. **Committee members should see**:
   - Committee features at top
   - Student dashboard below
   - "(Comité)" indicator in title
   - Logout button in top-right

The critical caching error has been eliminated and committee members now have the full functionality they need as both committee members and students.
